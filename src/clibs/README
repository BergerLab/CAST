clibs
=====
This is a collection of C libraries that I find frequent use for.

libds
=====
Contains implementations of commonly used data structures: hashmap, vector, 
linked list and a thread-safe queue that can be used in a 
multi-producer/multi-consumer algorithm.

The thread-safe queue is greatly inspired by the semantics of Go channels, 
although they are not emulated precisely. (Namely, there is no notion of an 
unbuffered channel, and there is no 'select' statement. I'm sure there are 
other differences, too.)

libopt
======
Contains a sane implementation of command line argument parsing. It is greatly 
inspired by Go's standard library 'flag' package.

(I really couldn't believe how horrendous 'getopt' was, and the Internet seems 
to expect me to use it since it's so ubiquitous. I found this distasteful, 
particularly as someone who has been spoiled with Python's 'argparse' module, 
and Go's 'flag' package.)

`libopt` can be used by compiling with `-lopt`, assuming that 'opt.h' and
'libopt.so' are in your C_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH, respectively.
